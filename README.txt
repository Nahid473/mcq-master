WHAT'S NEW
  - MCQ AI is now dynamic: every sub-category in q-manifest.js works automatically (for example "Ask about surveying", "জরিপ").
    The category/sub-category of each question comes from q-manifest.js, not from the header inside q-*.js.
  - Ask mode: "Ask question" / "Ask about <topic>" shows a question. Type A/B/C/D or the answer itself,
    "explain" shows answer + explanation, "next" shows a related question.
  - New prompts: related, I don't know, current question, question 3, how many correct, lessons of <topic>,
    random question, unseen questions, study plan, subject stats, explain all, how does ask work.
  - Daily: after Next, the new question scrolls to the top of the screen.
  - Search bar: focus glow, sweeping light line, pulsing icon while searching, typing placeholder, result cards slide in.
  - MCQ AI: 50 new prompts (say "commands" in the chat to see and tap them all):
      Quiz: repeat, 50 50, show answer, previous, restart, how many left, accuracy, streak, quiz mistakes,
            quiz skipped, slide these, practice these, harder, easier, swap question, time taken, reset score
      Sets: answers, answer 3, explain 3, set again, Next 10 without answers, then "1-B 2-A 3-C" to get marked
      Stats: my progress, best score, average score, last exam, how many wrong, weakest subject,
             strongest subject, list subjects, topics of math, daily status
      Pages: open search / history / bank / practice / daily / slider / read / add question / go home
      Extras: motivate me, study tip, what is the date, clear chat, surprise me, thanks, bye
      Most also work in Bangla, for example: আগের প্রশ্ন, আমার অগ্রগতি, সার্চ খোলো, শেষ পরীক্ষা, দুর্বল বিষয়.
